Given an existing function
  def load_predictions_txt(path: str, ignore_blanks: bool=false) -> List[Sample]
  where:
  Sample = NamedTuple('Sample', [('utterance', str), ('expected', str), ('predicted', str), ('score', float), ('additional_data', Dict[str, Any])])       
   
write an equivalent function that gets input data from a worksheet:
DATA_PREP_WORKSHEET = "data-prep"

and reads in the rows from the worksheet to process the data.

Basically, skip the header row and process each row from the worksheet just as if it were a line coming in from the file located at"
path
