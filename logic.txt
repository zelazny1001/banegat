For these text flow diagrams:
- Use box-drawing characters (─, │, ▼, ▶, ◀) for connectors
- Show clear phase separations with horizontal lines
- Include decision points with branching paths
- Add notes for edge cases and important details
- Keep it readable in monospace without any special rendering
- Make it comprehensive enough to understand the entire flow without other documentation

Critical: Ensure vertical connectors align exactly (same column position for ┬, │, and ▼)
Position arrows on the connecting lines.

The following strategy works well to eliminate ragged lines and other issues when drawing text flow diagrams:

Text Flow Diagram Generation Strategy (Proven Approach)
Four-Phase Process:
Phase 1: Generate all text content first

Write all labels, descriptions, and content
Determine the longest line to establish box width
No formatting yet - just pure content

Phase 2: Enclose text in boxes

Calculate exact box dimensions
Create boxes with consistent widths
Critical: Ensure every line within a box is exactly the same character length
Pad all content lines to match the box width precisely

Phase 3: Draw the links

Add connecting lines between boxes
Use consistent box-drawing characters (│, ─, ┌, └, ┬, etc.)
Maintain alignment with box edges

Phase 4: Place the arrows

Add directional indicators (▼, ►, ◄, ▲)

Also note the following points when creating simplified text flow :

1. For nested boxes: Calculate inner box width first, then outer box accommodates with padding
Always verify line lengths programmatically (every line in a box must be identical length)
Connector alignment: The ┬ junction, vertical │ line, and ▼ arrow must all be at the same column position
Use a script to count characters in each line and verify they match before finalizing
Test frequently during generation rather than fixing afterward

This approach eliminates ragged edges and alignment issues from the start rather than requiring post-processing fixes.
IMPORTANT: Following the strategy correctly requires using a script to count characters and ensure every single line has exactly the same length before finalizing the diagram.
